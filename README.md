The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a Java console-based application that allows a user to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game involves a series of rounds where the player selects one of three possible moves: "ROCK", "PAPER", or "SCISSORS". The computer's movement is randomly generated. The winner of each round is determined based on the classic rules of the game: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper.
